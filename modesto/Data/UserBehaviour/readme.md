This folder contains a script to generate (domestic hot water use, internal heat gains and day- and night-zone temperature profiles) profiles in line with the IS13790 standard. 

It also contains 50 StROBe profiles, stochastic profiles describing 
* domestic hot water use (mDHW.csv, [kg/s]), 
* convective internal heat gains (QCon.csv, [W]),
* radiative internal heat gains (QCon.csv, [W]),
* day-zone temperature profile (sh_day.csv, [degrees C]),
* night-zone temperature profiles (sh_day.csv, [degrees C])

These profiles are in the correct format for direct use in modesto
