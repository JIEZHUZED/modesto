Twin200Compound1000.csv
-----------------------

File containing pipe dimensions and resistance values.
All diameters expressed in m, resistance in Km/W.

DN is the nominal diameter in mm.
Dc is the diameter of the insulation jacket.
Di and Do are the inside and outside radius of the pipe wall, and s is the according thickness.
Dcc is the distance between the pipe walls for the twin pipes and between the insulation jackets for the compound single pipes.
Rs is the thermal resistance per unit length.

DN20-200 are twin pipes, DN250-1000 are compound single pipes.

The resistances Rs are calculated for a ground thermal conductivity of 1.8 W/mK, an insulation conductivity of 0.027 W/mK and the pipes are covered by a layer of 0.8 m of soil. This means that the effective buried depth is 0.8 + D_c/2.
