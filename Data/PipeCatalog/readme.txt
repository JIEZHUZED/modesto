Data regarding pipe dimensions and heat transfer parameters.
For single pipes, the following variables are used:
    DN:     Nominal diameter                                [mm]
    Di:     Actual inner diameter of pipe                   [m]
    Do:     Outer diameter of pipe and insulation together  [m]
    s:      Thickness of pipe wall (inside insulation)      [m]

For double pipes, the following variables are used:
    DN:     Nominal diameter                                [mm]
    Di:     Actual inner diameter of single pipes           [m]
    Dc:     Jacket pipe outside diameter                    [m]
    Do:     Outer diameter of single pipes                  [m]
    h:      Distance between pipe walls                     [m]
    s:      Wall thickness of pipe                          [m]
